## How AI Search Works (3-Step Process)

### 1. CRAWLING
- AI bots crawl your website (ChatGPT-User, PerplexityBot, Googlebot)
- **Critical:** Many AI crawlers don't execute JavaScript well
- **Action:** Ensure critical content in initial HTML

### 2. INDEXING (Vector Embeddings)
- Content converted to mathematical vectors (embeddings)
- **Key:** AI understands meaning, not just keywords
- **Example:** "Best laptop" matches "top portable computer" (semantic similarity)

### 3. RETRIEVAL & SYNTHESIS (RAG)
- User asks question → AI generates related sub-questions
- Searches vector database for semantically similar content
- Synthesizes answer from multiple sources
- Cites 3-10 sources per answer
