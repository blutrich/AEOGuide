### Why AI Traffic Converts Better

**User Behavior Explanation:**
1. **Pre-researched:** Users conduct extensive research in AI interface before clicking
2. **Higher intent:** By the time they click, they've narrowed consideration set
3. **Educated buyers:** Already compared alternatives and understand options
4. **Purchase-ready:** Arrive with specific questions, not exploratory browsing

**Contrast with Traditional Search:**
- Users often click for exploratory searches
- General information queries without purchase intent
- Less educated about options
- Earlier in decision-making process
